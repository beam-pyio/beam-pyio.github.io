We are happy to present the first release of Firehose PyIO Connector.

âœ¨NEW

- Add a composite transform (`WriteToFirehose`) that puts records into a Firehose delivery stream in batch, using the [`put_record_batch`](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/firehose/client/put_record_batch.html) method of the boto3 package.


<!--more-->

- Create a dedicated pipeline option (`FirehoseOptions`) that reads AWS related values (e.g. `aws_access_key_id`) from pipeline arguments.
- Implement metric objects that record the total, succeeded and failed elements counts.
- Add unit and integration testing cases. The [moto](https://github.com/getmoto/moto) and [localstack-utils](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/testing-utils/) packages are used for unit and integration testing respectively. Also, a custom test client is created for testing retry of failed elements, which is not supported by the moto package.

See [this post](/blog/2024/firehose-pyio-intro/) for more examples.
